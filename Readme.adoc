= TaskQueue for Swift with async/await
François Lamboley <fload@me.com>

A protocol which allows executing async tasks one after the other in an actor, given a task queue (an array of tasks).

If I’m not mistaken this will not be needed anymore at some point in the future when actor will be able to have their own execution queue.
